### **Project: Momentum-Based Algorithmic Trading Strategy Using Candlestick Patterns**

#### **Objective:**
Design and backtest an algorithmic trading strategy that identifies high-probability entry and exit points based on candlestick momentum patterns combined with support and resistance levels.

---

### **Candlestick Patterns for Strategy:**

1. **Engulfing Candlestick**:
   - **Bullish Engulfing**: Buy signal when a large green candle fully engulfs the previous red candle, particularly near a key support zone.
   - **Bearish Engulfing**: Sell signal when a large red candle fully engulfs the previous green candle near resistance.

2. **Momentum Candles**:
   - Look for large candles (relative to recent price movement) breaking out of consolidation zones.
   - Entry signals are validated by the breakout volume and alignment with broader trends.

3. **Doji Candles at Key Levels**:
   - Identify indecision candles (Doji) near significant support or resistance levels.
   - Act when followed by a strong momentum candle breaking in the trend direction.

4. **Hammer and Shooting Star**:
   - **Hammer**: Bullish reversal signal at support zones, validated by higher volume on the hammer day.
   - **Shooting Star**: Bearish reversal signal at resistance zones with a long upper wick.

5. **Marubozu Candles**:
   - Use Marubozu (candles with no or small wicks) to confirm strong trend continuation after a breakout or bounce from key levels.

### **Strategy Rules:**

#### **Entry Rules:**
1. Identify **key support/resistance levels** using moving averages (e.g., 50-day or 200-day) or Fibonacci retracements.
2. Look for momentum-based candlestick patterns (e.g., Engulfing, Marubozu) near these levels.
3. Validate breakouts or bounces with indicators like RSI (>50 for bullish, <50 for bearish) or MACD crossovers.
4. Enter trades only if volume during the signal candlestick is significantly above average.

#### **Exit Rules:**
1. Set profit targets using **risk-reward ratios** (e.g., 1:2).
2. Use trailing stop-losses based on Average True Range (ATR) to lock in profits during trends.
3. Exit if a reversal candlestick (e.g., Shooting Star or Bearish Engulfing) forms against the trade.

### **Technical Features:**

1. **Multi-Candle Patterns**:
   Combine Doji candles with engulfing or momentum patterns for confirmation of trend reversals or continuations.

2. **Dynamic Stop-Loss and Take-Profit**:
   Adjust stop-losses and take-profits based on recent volatility (measured by ATR).

3. **Indicator Overlay**:
   - Use RSI to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
   - Employ Bollinger Bands to confirm breakout strength.

4. **Limit Order Book Analysis** (Optional):
   - Incorporate real-time data to measure liquidity and optimize entry/exit points.

### **Performance Metrics:**
1. **Sharpe Ratio**: Assess risk-adjusted returns.
2. **Win Rate**: Measure the percentage of profitable trades.
3. **Max Drawdown**: Monitor the largest peak-to-trough decline in equity.
4. **Profit Factor**: Ratio of gross profits to gross losses.

### **Implementation Tools:**
1. **Data Sources**:
   - Use historical candlestick data from APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl.
   - For limit order book data, use Binance, Interactive Brokers, or similar platforms.

2. **Libraries**:
   - **Backtesting**: `Backtrader`, `PyAlgoTrade`, or `Zipline`.
   - **Indicators**: `TA-Lib` or `Pandas TA`.
   - **Visualization**: `Matplotlib` or `Plotly` for trade performance charts.

This strategy allows you to combine momentum concepts with classic candlestick patterns while validating trades using broader market trends and indicators. Let me know if you want specific implementation details or code snippets!
